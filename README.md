# ðŸ“‚ CSV to JSON Converter â€“ Python

This project contains a Python script to automatically convert CSV files to JSON. 
It also includes a helper script (`Create.py`) to generate a sample file (`people_data.csv`) for easier testing.

---

## ðŸš€ How it works

âœ… **`main.py`** â€“ Converts any CSV file to JSON automatically, keeping the same name as the input file.  
âœ… **`Create.py`** â€“ Creates a sample file (`people_data.csv`) with 20 dummy records (names, ages, and cities) to test the converter.
---

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Python standard** libraries (no need to install anything extra to run `main.py`)
- Only for `Create.py` is it necessary to install **Pandas**:

```bash
pip install pandas
```
